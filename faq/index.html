                    <strong>What is the National Geography Bee?</strong>
                    <p>
                        We’re an organization dedicated to promoting geographical knowledge and education nationwide. Our primary focus is
                        organizing the National Geography Bee, a nationwide competition for high schoolers that aims to inspire and build
                        curiosity about the people and places around them—including their home state, the United States as a whole, and the world at large. We will
                        be filing for 501(c)3 status in the coming days.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="mb-4">
                    <strong>Are you at all tied to any of the other national geography competitions?</strong>
                    <p>
                        We are completely independent of and totally unaffiliated with National Geographic, which used to run a geography bee
                        for fourth through eighth graders until 2020, as well as any other organization that runs geography competitions at any level. While
                        we both did compete in the National Geographic competition when we were younger, we are not associated with nor do we
                        receive any help or guidance from National Geographic.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="mb-4">
                    <strong>When is it?</strong>
                    <p>
                        Schools will have between February 1 and March 15, 2026, to hold school bees to determine a school champion (see below for more details). Local county bees (or equivalent) will be on March 27, 2026. County champions will move on to the national
                        championship in May 2026, in Cambridge, MA.

                    <strong>I’m a middle school teacher. Can my school participate?</strong>
                    <p>
                        While we hope to roll out a middle school competition at the same scale in the next few years, at this point in time the
                        competition is for <b>high schools only.</b>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="mb-4">
                    <strong>Is there an entry fee?</strong>
                    <p>
                        We do ask for a $50 entry fee per school, but are happy to waive or reduce this fee if it is an obstacle to your
                        participation! Additionally, if you successfully refer another school to the competition, we will reduce your entry fee by $5.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="mb-4">
                    <strong>How hard is it going to be?</strong>
                    <p>
                        As students progress in the competition, the questions will get harder, but the point of our competition is that—at
                        least at the start—it is accessible to students generally, even ones who may not already be geography geeks.

                    <strong>How does it work at the school level?</strong>
                    <p>
                        We will be sending a detailed packet of instructions after you register, but the short version is that there will be a 30-minute written test administered at the class level, and the top performers on that test will move on to a school-wide oral bee to determine the school champion. We want to make your school's hosting experience as seamless as possible, so you won't need to take very much time out of your classes.
